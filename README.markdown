In order to run it, you need to install a few things

 - Python
 - CherryPy 3
 - Mako Templates

On Ubuntu 11.04, to install it just run the following in a terminal:

`sudo apt-get install python-markdown python-cherrypy3 python-mako`

things and just run test.py.

 - Make 'log.screen': True
 - Change the port numer
